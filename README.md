# Safe Journey

Travel can be amazing and life-changing, but for some people, like members of the LGBTQIA+ community, people of colour and women, it can also mean discrimination and harassment. Safe Journey was created so users can share and report their travel experiences. Users can give a country a rating out of 5 and a detailed review. Sharing this information allows others to be prepared and to make well-informed decisions about where and how they travel.

## Our approach

Our approach was influenced by agile methodologies. We used Trello (Kanban board) to track tasks (to do/doing/done) and prepared a user story:

> **As a** person who is more likely to face discrimination or harassment when travelling,
> **I want to** hear from other people who are like me their experiences travelling in different countries
> **so that** I can be prepared and make decisions and plan where and how I travel.

We used Figma to create a detailed mockup of the app.

## Achievements

We were inspired to create an app that could benefit people who are more likely to experience discrimination when travelling. We kept these users front of mind when designing and creating the app. For example we were aware that revisiting their negative travel experiences could be difficult or upsetting for some users, so we provided support service resources.

Throughout this project, which was completed over a 4-day sprint, we took on the combined roles of project managers, UX/UI designers and front-end and back-end developers. We improved our knowledge of important tools like Trello, Figma and GitHub.

We took advantage of the differing strengths of our team members and worked effectively as a team to successfully deliver Safe Journey.
