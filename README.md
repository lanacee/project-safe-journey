# Safe Journey

Safe Journey was created for people who may encounter discrimination or harassment when travelling, such as women, people of colour and members of the LGBTQI+ community. The app allows users to report both their positive and negative experiences in other countries. Users can rate a location out of 5 stars and provide detailed information about their experiences. Sharing this information allows others to make well-informed decisions about their travel plans.
