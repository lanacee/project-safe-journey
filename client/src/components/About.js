            <p>Travel can be amazing and life-changing, but for some people, like members of the LGBTQIA+ community, people of colour and women, it can also mean discrimination and harassment.</p>
            <p>Safe Journey was created so users can share and report their travel experiences. Users can give a country a rating out of 5 and a detailed review.</p>
            <p>Sharing this information allows others to be prepared and to make well-informed decisions about where and how they travel.</p>
