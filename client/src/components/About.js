          Travel can be amazing and life-changing, but for some people, like
          members of the LGBTQIA+ community, people of colour and women, it can
          also mean discrimination and harassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safe Journey was created so users can share and report their travel
          experiences. Users can give a country a rating out of 5 and a detailed
          review.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharing this information allows others to be prepared and to make
          well-informed decisions about where and how they travel.
